# GHOST Simulator
See https://jimmytech.notion.site/Ghost-de748728e51a453288c075e56b2c64e3 for the computer specifications and instruction set

## Operation
Check the `readme.md` in each subfolder that explains that programs purpose and operation.

### Please add issues for feature requests, instruction set requests, bugs, etc...
While this is my fourth attempt at this, I still don't fully understand how _real_ assembly works, so I might have misunderstood some basic concepts. Feel free to let me know!
